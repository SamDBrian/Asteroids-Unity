# Asteroids-Unity
This is a clone of Asteroids using Unity, based on a tutorial by Zigurous (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIeWhztKyAg).

I have been making substantial alterations to Zigurous's original program to teach myself Unity.

Changes so far:
- Implemented Screen Wrapping for ships, asteroids, and bullets.
- Replaced Zigurous's physics based turning to improve ship handling.
- Added Missiles that can be fired by clicking on the screen. 
--- Missiles are launch from the side of the ship unpowered, then fly towards their target and detonate.
- Added Game Over screen. 
- Added Lives Counter and score.
- Added main menu and controls screen.
- Added an enemy spaceship that shows up every 20 or so seconds.
- Adjusted the spawn system to better match the original Asteroids
--- Asteroids spawn moving away from the player.
--- Game now spawns 4 large asteroids at the start and adds 1 large asteroid every time the player clears a level.

All sprites were made by me based on the sprites from Asteroids.

Font is Hyperspace.
