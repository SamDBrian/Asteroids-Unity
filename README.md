# Asteroids-Unity
This is a clone of Asteroids using Unity, based on a tutorial by Zigurous (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIeWhztKyAg).

I have been making substantial alterations to Zigurous's original program to teach myself unity.

Changes so far:
- Implemented Screen Wrapping
--- Screen wrapping based on the edge of the camera.
- Added Missiles that can be fired by clicking on the screen. 
--- Missiles are launch from the side of the ship unpowered, then accelerate towards their target and detonate.
- Added Game Over screen. 
- Added Lives Counter.
- Added the ability to flip the ship 180 degrees with the s key.

Goals:
- Replace physics based turning with more controlled turning.
- Implement "New Game" button after Game Over.
