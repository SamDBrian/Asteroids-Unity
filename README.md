# Disasteroids
This is an "Asteroids" clone made using Unity. 

Playable via: https://rvengefulobster.itch.io/disasteroids

Based on a heavily modified version of a tutorial by Zigurous (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIeWhztKyAg). I have made substantial alterations to Zigurous's original code base to teach myself Unity.

Changes so far:
- Implemented Screen Wrapping for ships, asteroids, and bullets.
- Replaced Zigurous's physics based turning to improve ship handling.
- Added Missiles that can be fired by clicking on the screen. 
--- Missiles are launch from the side of the ship unpowered, then fly towards their target and detonate.
- Added Game Over screen. 
- Added Lives Counter and on screen score.
- Added main menu and controls screen.
- Added an enemy spaceship that shows up every 20.
- Overhauled the Asteroid Spawn system to better match the original Asteroids
--- Asteroids spawn moving away from the player.
--- Game now spawns 4 large asteroids at the start and adds 1 large asteroid every time the player clears a level.

All sprites were made by me based on the sprites from Asteroids.

Font is Hyperspace by Pixel Saga.
